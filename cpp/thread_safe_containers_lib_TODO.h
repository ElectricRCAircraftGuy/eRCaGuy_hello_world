Add code for thread-safe queues, deques, vectors, maps, etc. (template it
for *any* type), to safely share data between multiple threads. This will
simply require a basic mutex.

Include mechanisms for basic thread synchronization and notifying too, by waking
up threads to notify them there is data for them to read, via
`std::condition_variable`s and all.
