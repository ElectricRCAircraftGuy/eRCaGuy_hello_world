Demonstrate how to initialize a C-style array of structs in C++.

Arduino set LED struct:
- demonstrate an alternative way to initialize an array of structs in C++, both
  inside a function after construction, and during initialization at
  construction.
- Note: changing the contents of the array of structs inside a function is most
  useful when struct contents need to be changed often, not necessarily when
  initializing a struct once. If it just needs to be done once, you can just
  use the technique to initialize the array of structs once at construction.

STATUS: Done and works!

To compile and run (assuming you've already `cd`ed into this dir):
```bash
# NB: you may need to use `-std=gnu++17` instead of `-std=c++17` in order to obtain extra GNU
# gcc features, including gcc extensions, POSIX cmds, and Linux sytem cmds.
# See: [my answer]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71801111/4561887

# 1. In C++
time g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c++17 struct_array_initialization.cpp -o bin/a && bin/a
```
