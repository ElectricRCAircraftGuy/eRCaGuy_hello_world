# Folder description

1. `abandoned` = files I do _not_ plan to finish, but which I want to keep because I may reference them or their ideas again later. This includes failed ideas which I thought might work but did not, and they don't make good demos as-is. Again, I do _not_ plan to finish these.
1. `TODO` = files already in-work, but not yet functional, or ideas which I'd like to begin and work on. I plan to finish these.


# TODO

Do my ideas and things in the files in the `todo` directory.
