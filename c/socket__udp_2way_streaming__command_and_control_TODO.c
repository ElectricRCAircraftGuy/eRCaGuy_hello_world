Make this a "command and control" demo. One side continually streams control commands (think: as
though from a 6 CH RC Tx), and the other side continually streams back telemetry data (as though
from an RC vehicle, back to the Tx, for display purposes, like voltage, speed, altitude, heading,
Euler angles, etc.).
