Based on skills learned from 2012 to 2023.

Demonstrate a basic, efficient ring buffer FIFO in C (that also runs in C++).

- NB: This code assumes that your hardware and compiler supports modern C11 (see here:
  https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/thread#Atomic_operations) or C++11 (see here:
  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic) atomic types, so that the ring buffer array
  data (stored in `array`), and the indices (`i_write` and `i_read`) have at least **atomic
  copies**. This means that they MUST be able to be written to or read from withOUT being
  interrupted in the middle of reading or writing bytes from or to those variables. If this is NOT
  the case for your compiler or architecture, you have two options to fix this code:

    1. Use naturally-atomic read-and-write types for those 3 variables.

        1. For 8-bit Arduino AVR microcontrollers, that means they must be **8-bit** variable types!
            Ex:
            ```cpp
            uint8_t* array;  // for the data in the ring buffer
            uint8_t i_write; // ring buffer write index
            uint8_t i_read;  // ring buffer read index
            ```
            See my detailed Q&A here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39693278/4561887

        1. For 32-bit STM32 microcontrollers, that means they must be **32-bit or smaller** variable
        types! See my answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52785864/4561887

    2. Use atomic access guards. See some of my very-detailed Q&As on this here:
        1. my Q&A on STM32 mcus: https://stackoverflow.com/q/71626597/4561887
        1. my Q&A on Arduino AVR mcus: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39693278/4561887
        1. my ans. on spin locks: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73819087/4561887

- Note: I have written many ring buffers, and studied a variety of different techniques, and this
  implementation is the **best of all of them!** It is the best I have ever written or seen, for the
  following reasons:
  <============== REASONS WHY THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT ===============

    1. Benefit 1: first and foremost: this implementation is **lock free** so long as the following
    conditions are met:

        1. There is only **single-direction** usage (ex: where only the ISR ever writes and adds
        elements, and only the main loop ever reads and removes elements) **and**:

        1. The hardware & compiler supports the `atomic_*` types to guarantee atomic reads, **or**:

            1. the variable types are small enough to have **naturally atomic** reads and writes
            (see above), or

            1. atomic access guards are used for all reads and writes on the 3 variables of
            interest (data and indices x 2) (see above).

    2. Benefit 2: it does NOT have the "reduced by one" problem, where the usable space in the array
    has to be reduced by 1 element in order to see when the buffer is full.

    3. Benefit 3: it does NOT have to store an additional `size_t count` variable to count the
    number of elements in the array.

        - Rather, this implementation works by **never** writing the "modulus"ed value into the
          `i_write` and `i_read` indices. This way, the buffer is empty if `i_write == i_read`, and
          it is full if `i_write - i_read == len`. This works because for a buffer of length 2, for
          instance, `i_read` might be 0, for instance, while `i_write` is 2 (where `2 % len` is 0).
          If you performed the modulus and *then* stored that "modulus"ed value into `i_read` and
          `i_write` instead, then `i_write` would be 0 instead of 2, and you'd have a situation
          where `i_write - i_read` would equal 0 *both* when it is empty *and* when it is full!

          This is problematic, as you would have no way to identify when the buffer is full vs.
          empty without violating one of my other two bullets just above. That's the ingenuity of
          this approach! I came up with it on my own during a live interview years ago. I had never
          seen nor heard of this approach before, but when it occurred to me, I knew it was the
          best approach I had ever seen, and I have since decided to make it my standard way of
          doing ring buffers. The only reason I might change and use a different technique is if
          this approach of performing the modulus operation **during indexing usage** turns out to
          be slower. In that case, I might make the tiny sacrifice in **space efficiency** to get a
          gain in **time efficiency**, but I haven't yet done any speed profiling to see if that is
          a time gain that can be achieved.

STATUS: done and works!
