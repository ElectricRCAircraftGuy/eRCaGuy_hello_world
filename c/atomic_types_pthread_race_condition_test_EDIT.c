Demonstrate how to force types in the C language to have atomic reads, atomic writes, atomic
increment, atomic decrement, and atomic compound assignment. See the extensive links and details on
this in my **question** here: https://stackoverflow.com/q/71866535/4561887.

The only guarantees for atomicity by the language standards are to use `_Atomic` types in C11 or
later or `std::atomic<>` types in C++11 or later.

STATUS & RESULTS: Done! Works great! Comment out `#define USE_ATOMIC_TYPES` below, and run it. Then
uncomment it and run it again, to compare results! You'll see that when using atomic variables, you
get the expected `10000000` (10 million) value for each counter, but when NOT using atomic
variables, you'll only get each counter up to about half that, or `4274108` (4.3 million), for
instance!

Update 30 Dec. 2022: I have no idea what I was trying to do here with these changes, so I copied <================= UPDATE DEC 2022 ===================
them out into this new file. See the changes I had made in the last 9 months or so like this, and
continue them if they make any sense:
```bash
meld c/atomic_types_pthread_race_condition_test.c c/atomic_types_pthread_race_condition_test_EDIT.c
```

To compile and run (assuming you've already `cd`ed into this dir):
```bash
# Why `-std=gnu17` vs `-std=c17`, and `-std=gnu++17` vs `-std=c++17`?
# See: [my answer]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71801111/4561887

# 1. In C:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=gnu17 atomic_types_pthread_race_condition_test.c -o bin/a -lm -pthread && time bin/a

# 2. In C++
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=gnu++17 atomic_types_pthread_race_condition_test.c -o bin/a -pthread && time bin/a
```
