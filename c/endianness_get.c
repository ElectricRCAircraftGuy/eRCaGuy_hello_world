Write a function to determine and print out the endianness of the system.

STATUS: done and works!

To compile and run (assuming you've already `cd`ed into this dir):
1. In C:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c17 endianness_get.c -o bin/a -lm && bin/a
```
2. In C++
```bash
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c++17 endianness_get.c -o bin/a && bin/a
```

   > As said earlier, big endian is also called network byte order, while little endian is called
     host byte order. There are a set of functions to convert 16-bit and 32-bit integers to network
     byte order and vice versa. The htons (host-to-network-short) and htonl
     (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16-bit and 32-bit values respectively from host
     (machine) to network byte order; the ntohs and ntohl functions convert from network to host
     byte order. You can read more on endianness and information representation here.
