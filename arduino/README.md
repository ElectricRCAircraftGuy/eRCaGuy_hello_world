# TODO:
1. [ ] Add "fill_array_with_analogRead.ino" demo. See my code here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28888135/4561887


# Select explanations of programs:

1. `coulomb_counter_with_cooperative_multitasking_macro` - this is an _excellent_ example of a **coulomb counter** (energy usage or generation measurer; AKA: battery "fuel" gauge measurement system, or **battery "State of Charge" (SoC) estimator**) to obtain energy in Joules (J), Watt-Hours (Whr), or Kilowatt-Hours (KWhr). 
    1. I have posted this code online here: [Arduino Stack Exchange: Calculating Amp/Hrs of a solar panel](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/75937/7727).
    1. It uses my sophisticated `CREATE_TASK_TIMER()` cooperative multi-tasking macro.
    1. I first wrote about this technique starting in 2018 here: [Stack Overflow: How to do **high-resolution, timestamp-based, non-blocking, single-threaded cooperative multi-tasking**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50032992/4561887)


# Arduino examples of note

1. https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/analog/Smoothing - this is a brilliant and extremely efficient basic _moving average_ algorithm for basic data smoothing and digital signal processing (DSP). If you aren't doing your moving averages in professional code like this, you should be. It's the most-efficient technique for a moving average that I've ever seen, and a template and model for all.
