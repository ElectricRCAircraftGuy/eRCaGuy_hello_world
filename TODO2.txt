Timing improvements in "cpp/timing_and_precision_Windows_and_Linux_tests.cpp" and "cpp/Windows_WIP/" et al:
[ ] add a periodic stats print task to show CPU usage, loop freq, avg. processing time, etc. once per second! 
    [ ] Estimate CPU usage in the main loop too.
        cpu usage = non_sleep_time/total_time
        total_time = sleep_time + non_sleep_time
[ ] Answer this question here!: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13397571/precise-thread-sleep-needed-max-1ms-error
    [ ] Be sure to state my exact OSs, hardware, and compiler versions used on each OS.
[ ] Update my main C++ precision timing Stack Overflow answer with a new section on this.
[ ] Update and commit my cpp/timing_and_precision_Windows_and_Linux_tests.cpp changes on Linux. 
    [ ] Add a struct to capture all relevant inputs, outputs, stats, etc. Make it global for expediency.
    [ ] Tabulate the results at the end (use AI). 
    [ ] write up results into a new answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13397571/precise-thread-sleep-needed-max-1ms-error
[ ] Add my changes from Windows into that file too. 
[ ] Add sleep tests to easily test these things: 
    [x] *****+OPEN AND STUDY THIS AI chat: https://share.google/aimode/8zx15oregqzPE3Q98
    [x] 1) normal C++ `std::this_thread::sleep_for()`
    [ ] 2) `std::this_thread::sleep_for()` with Windows special call for high precision sleep (doesn't work)
    [ ] 3) Windows Sleep() call withOUT the 1ms precision fix 
    [ ] 4) Windows Sleep() call WITH the 1ms precision fix
    [x] BE SURE TO have each sleep function allow CPU-usage timing by returning via output pointers the actual sleep time!
[ ] Windows Sleep() - don't wrap with timeBeginPeriod()/timeEndPeriod() calls--wasted time: ~200 us each call (range: 2~500us); instead, use the special Windows API call to set high precision sleep globally for the whole program!
[ ] Save my sleep_until_ms func in my hello world repo, and add it to stack overflow!!

NEXT:
[x] Have sleep_test() use my stats struct and function to calculate stats
[ ] git commit the work 
[ ] store stats into a global vector or something
[ ] print a markdown table of the results
[ ] begin implementing more of the sleep funcs with the different mechanisms to sleep
