_Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 22.04._


## 1. The basics

1. Create a virtual (dummy) adapter/interface
    ```bash
    # 1. Install the "dummy" socket interface Linux kernel module.
    sudo modprobe dummy

    # 2. Ensure the "dummy" Linux kernel module is installed.
    sudo lsmod | grep dummy

    # 3. View all existing socket interfaces/adapters, whether WiFi, Ethernet,
    # or virtual (dummy)
    ip address
    ip a  # or (short version of the command above)

    # 4. Create a virtual (dummy) interface named `eth_dummy`.
    sudo ip link add eth_dummy type dummy

    # 5. View it. You'll now see "eth_dummy" as one of your attached interfaces.
    ip address

    # 6. Add an IP address and netmask to this new dummy interface. Use any IP
    # address and netmask you like. Ex: `10.0.0.1/24` in this case. 
    # - Note that the `/24` means that the first (most-significant, or
    #   left-most) 24 bits of the 32-bit netmask will be set to 1's. This
    #   (`/24`) is the same as `255.255.255.0`. See below for details and a
    #   full list of possible netmasks.
    # - See `ip address help` for command syntax help. 
    sudo ip address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth_dummy

    # 7. See the newly-created device and the IP address you just
    # assigned to it.
    ip address
    ```

    That's it!

1. Add as many IP addresses as you want to your dummy interface: 

    In case you are using sockets to receive from (bind to, and receive on) many different IP addresses at once, you can easily add them all to this one dummy interface. 

    Here, I am adding two more IP addresses and netmasks as I see fit:
    ```bash
    sudo ip address add 192.168.2.1/24 dev eth_dummy
    sudo ip address add 10.5.4.1/8 dev eth_dummy
    ```

    `ip address` now shows the following for my `eth_dummy` virtual (`type dummy`) interface. So, I can have my C, C++, Python, etc. sockets bind to IP addresses `10.0.0.1`, `192.168.2.1`, and `10.5.4.1` on this interface. This is great for airplane travel when you need to test your network and simulated output packets without having a real network switch plugged into your computer (I'm on an airplane now as I write this. Pretty sure that puts me in the "mile high" coding club). 
    ```bash
    10: eth_dummy: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 4a:e7:bc:8f:2e:2d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 10.0.0.1/24 scope global eth_dummy
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet 192.168.2.1/24 scope global eth_dummy
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet 10.5.4.1/8 scope global eth_dummy
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```

1. To delete this dummy interface:
    ```bash
    # 1. Delete this `eth_dummy` dummy device you created.
    sudo ip link delete eth_dummy

    # 2. Ensure 'eth_dummy' is deleted and doesn't show up here now.
    ip address
    ```

Done!


## 2. Netmasks

Here is a full list of possible netmasks when setting the IP address and netmask as `ip/netmask`, such as `10.0.0.1/24`. The `/24` here means that the first (most-significant, or left-most) 24 bits of the 32-bit netmask will be set to `1`s. Netmask `/24` is the same as `255.255.255.0`. 

Here is a full list of possible netmasks:

Whole-byte netmasks:
```
/32 = 255.255.255.255
/24 = 255.255.255.0     # <== most common
/16 = 255.255.0.0
/8  = 255.0.0.0
/0  = 0.0.0.0           # (I don't even know if this is a valid option)
```

All netmasks:
```
/32 = 255.255.255.255
/31 = 255.255.255.254
/30 = 255.255.255.252
/29 = 255.255.255.248
/28 = 255.255.255.240
/27 = 255.255.255.224
/26 = 255.255.255.192
/25 = 255.255.255.128
/24 = 255.255.255.0     # <== most common
/23 = 255.255.254.0
/22 = 255.255.252.0
/21 = 255.255.248.0
/20 = 255.255.240.0
/19 = 255.255.224.0
/18 = 255.255.192.0
/17 = 255.255.128.0
/16 = 255.255.0.0
/15 = 255.254.0.0
/14 = 255.252.0.0
/13 = 255.248.0.0
/12 = 255.240.0.0
/11 = 255.224.0.0
/10 = 255.192.0.0
/9 = 255.128.0.0
/8 = 255.0.0.0
/7 = 254.0.0.0
/6 = 252.0.0.0
/5 = 248.0.0.0
/4 = 240.0.0.0
/3 = 224.0.0.0
/2 = 192.0.0.0
/1 = 128.0.0.0
/0 = 0.0.0.0            # (I don't even know if this is a valid option)
```


## 3. More details

`lsmod` shows "the status of modules in the Linux Kernel" (see `man lsmod`). Try it out! Just type in
```bash
lsmod
```

One of the modules is called `dummy`. Let's look to see it's there:
```bash
$ lsmod | grep dummy
dummy                  16384  0
```

Yep, it's there. Good. That Linux kernel module _must_ be present for you to be able to run the `sudo ip link add eth_dummy type dummy` command above to create the virtual interface using the `dummy` kernel module. If you don't have it, see [@slm's answer][1]. 

Before you create a new virtual interface, run this to see what IP addresses and interfaces you already have:
```bash
ip address
```

You can also take a look at this:
```bash
ifconfig
```

After you have created your new virtual interface, you will see it in the output of the `ip address` command above. Note: `ifconfig` may not show a virtual, dummy device you create, but `ip address` will.

----

Wait, but my coworker ran `sudo ip addr change dev eth_dummy 10.0.0.1`, in place of `sudo ip address change dev eth_dummy 10.0.0.1` (notice `addr` in place of `address`). Or, maybe they ran `sudo ip a change dev eth_dummy 10.0.0.1` (notice `a` in place of `address`). What's up with that!?

Well, this particular command only needs enough of its characters to ensure it knows what you mean. In other words, _once you have enough characters in the command for it to know you couldn't possibly mean any other command, it accepts it._ Since no other subcommand after `ip` starts with the letter `a`, `ip a` is enough. Therefore, all of the below commands are equivalent:
```bash
ip address
ip addres
ip addre
ip addr
ip add
ip ad
ip a
```

Just be aware of this weird sort of thing when sharing information and looking at the `help` menus and `man` pages (shown in my references below). Otherwise, you'll be all sorts of confused, like I was, when no matter how hard you search you can't find the `a` (as in `ip a`) or `addr` (as in `ip addr`) commands listed anywhere in these page. Just realize both of those are short for `address`. Ah...now _there it is_ in the help pages!
```bash
$ ip help
Usage: ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }
       ip [ -force ] -batch filename
where  OBJECT := { link | address | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable |
                   tunnel | tuntap | maddress | mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm |
                   netns | l2tp | fou | macsec | tcp_metrics | token | netconf | ila |
                   vrf | sr }
       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -s[tatistics] | -d[etails] | -r[esolve] |
                    -h[uman-readable] | -iec |
                    -f[amily] { inet | inet6 | ipx | dnet | mpls | bridge | link } |
                    -4 | -6 | -I | -D | -B | -0 |
                    -l[oops] { maximum-addr-flush-attempts } | -br[ief] |
                    -o[neline] | -t[imestamp] | -ts[hort] | -b[atch] [filename] |
                    -rc[vbuf] [size] | -n[etns] name | -a[ll] |Â -c[olor]}
                    ```

And `ip address help` (or `man ip address`), _to see the existence of the `ip address change` command!_:
```bash
$ ip address help
Usage: ip address {add|change|replace} IFADDR dev IFNAME [ LIFETIME ]
                                                      [ CONFFLAG-LIST ]
       ip address del IFADDR dev IFNAME [mngtmpaddr]
       ip address {save|flush} [ dev IFNAME ] [ scope SCOPE-ID ]
                            [ to PREFIX ] [ FLAG-LIST ] [ label LABEL ] [up]
       ip address [ show [ dev IFNAME ] [ scope SCOPE-ID ] [ master DEVICE ]
                         [ type TYPE ] [ to PREFIX ] [ FLAG-LIST ]
                         [ label LABEL ] [up] [ vrf NAME ] ]
       ip address {showdump|restore}
IFADDR := PREFIX | ADDR peer PREFIX
          [ broadcast ADDR ] [ anycast ADDR ]
          [ label IFNAME ] [ scope SCOPE-ID ]
SCOPE-ID := [ host | link | global | NUMBER ]
FLAG-LIST := [ FLAG-LIST ] FLAG
FLAG  := [ permanent | dynamic | secondary | primary |
           [-]tentative | [-]deprecated | [-]dadfailed | temporary |
           CONFFLAG-LIST ]
CONFFLAG-LIST := [ CONFFLAG-LIST ] CONFFLAG
CONFFLAG  := [ home | nodad | mngtmpaddr | noprefixroute | autojoin ]
LIFETIME := [ valid_lft LFT ] [ preferred_lft LFT ]
LFT := forever | SECONDS
TYPE := { vlan | veth | vcan | vxcan | dummy | ifb | macvlan | macvtap |
          bridge | bond | ipoib | ip6tnl | ipip | sit | vxlan | lowpan |
          gre | gretap | erspan | ip6gre | ip6gretap | ip6erspan | vti |
          nlmon | can | bond_slave | ipvlan | geneve | bridge_slave |
