This is the only answer here which performs _multi-process_ (like multi-threaded) search in order to dramatically speed up the `git grep` searches. I'll also cover a variety of tools and scenarios. 

_This should work in Windows, Mac, and Linux. Tested on Windows 11 in Git Bash, and on Linux Ubuntu 22.04._

For Windows, [use](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/411#issuecomment-1917413008) the Git Bash Linux-like terminal that comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). You can also use the MSYS2 terminal. 

Here are my installation instructions for those terminals in Windows:

## 1. Search the tips of all branches in a git repository

This answers the main question: 

> Is it possible to perform a 'grep search' in all the branches of a Git project?

Her are the answers on how to search for `'my regex search'`. Note that the `time` command in the front is just to time how long it takes. You can optionally remove that part. Here are the solutions:

```bash
# 1. Search all local branches
time git branch | awk '{print $NF}' \
    | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" git --no-pager grep 'my regex search'

# 2. Search all remote branches of all remotes
# A. Fetch all remote branches of `--all` remote repositories, to ensure that 
# your locally-stored remote-tracking branches are all up-to-date.
git fetch --all  
# B. Now perform the search
time git branch -r | awk '{print $NF}' \
    | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" git --no-pager grep 'my regex search'

# 3. Search all local and remote branches
# A. Fetch all remote branches of `--all` remote repositories, to ensure that
# your locally-stored remote-tracking branches are all up-to-date.
git fetch --all
# B. Now perform the search
time git branch -a | awk '{print $NF}' \
    | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" git --no-pager grep 'my regex search'
```

#### Explanation

1. `git branch` lists all local branches
1. `git branch -r` lists all locally-stored, remote-tracking branches
1. `git branch -a` lists all local and remote branches
1. `awk '{print $NF}'` prints only the last field (column) of each line, which is the branch name. `$NF` means "Number of Fields", so this grabs the last field (column). This removes the leading spaces before the branch names, as well as the `*` character in front of the current branch name.
1. `xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)"` runs the command command following it in parallel, with 1 argument (branch name, in this case) per process, and with the number of processes allowed to run at once equal to the number of processors on your machine (`-P "$(nproc)"`). This is the key to speeding up the search. 

    To prove it, I ran a test search in a medium-sized repository (\~100 MB in the .git dir) both with and without parallelization, and here are the results. I was searching for the fixed string `-F` `STATIC_ASSERT(`:

    ```bash
    # 0.433 sec on Linux Ubuntu 22.04       0.564 sec on Windows 11 in Git Bash
    # With parallelization (I have 20 logical cores on my Dell Precision 
    # 5570 laptop):
    time git branch | awk '{print $NF}' \
        | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" git --no-pager grep -F 'STATIC_ASSERT('

    # 1.215 sec on Linux Ubuntu 22.04       0.640 sec on Windows 11 in Git Bash
    # No parallelization: 
    time git branch | awk '{print $NF}' \
        | xargs git --no-pager grep -F 'STATIC_ASSERT('
    ```

1. `git --no-pager grep 'my regex search'` searches for the regex (regular expression) `'my regex search'` in the given branch name. The `--no-pager` option is used to prevent the `less` pager from being used, which otherwise disables echo in your terminal and causes it to no longer display characters you type.

    See my question and this answer by @wjandrea here: [Git Grep sometimes makes terminal stop showing typed commands](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77904031/4561887)


## 2. Search in all commits of a git repository

`git rev-list --all`, as shown [in the main answer by @VonC](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15293283/4561887), lists all commits reachable from any branch or tag in the whole repository. To search _all_ commits, therefore, not just the head commit at the tip of each branch name, we will use `git rev-list --all` instead of `git branch`:

```bash
# Search all commits (reachable from any branch or tag) in the whole repository
time git rev-list --all \
    | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" git --no-pager grep 'my regex search'
```

Performing this search in the same repository as above, I get the following speed test results:

```bash
# 12.423 sec on Linux Ubuntu 22.04      35.808 sec on Windows 11 in Git Bash
# With parallelization.
time git rev-list --all \
    | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" git --no-pager grep 'STATIC_ASSERT'

# 33.253 sec on Linux Ubuntu 22.04     42.666 sec on Windows 11 in Git Bash 
# No parallelization.
time git rev-list --all | xargs git --no-pager grep 'STATIC_ASSERT'



```













## 3. Search just the current file-system

This includes the current branch plus any changes or new files not yet committed, but none of the other branches or past commits. 

Install Ripgrep ...[my answer]

```bash
# Fastest: ripgrep
rg

# Okay
git grep
git grep 'STATIC_ASSERT' commit -- my_file.c

# Slowest
grep
```

## 4. Alternative forms



```bash
# Works!
time git rev-list --all | xargs -P "$(nproc)" -I {} git --no-pager grep 'STATIC_ASSERT' {} -- my_file.c



# Works!
time git rev-list --all | xargs -n 1 -P "$(nproc)" sh -c 'git --no-pager grep "STATIC_ASSERT" "$0" -- my_file.c'
```
