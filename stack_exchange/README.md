# Stack Exchange research and answers

I'll store partial answers and learning notes and documentation here.

As I conduct research and document what I learn, for later retrieval and use, I frequently compile my information into answers on Stack Exchange websites such as Stack Overflow, Unix & Linux, Ask Ubuntu, Electronics, or Arduino. However, having 3 kids and a full-time job, I get frequent interruptions, some of which can block me from finishing the research and documentation for days, weeks, or even months or years at times. 

When interruptions are that severe and prolonged, it's easy to lose many hours of valuable research and documentation which I'd really have liked to save somewhere. 

Let this folder be that place. 

Let this folder be a place where I can save work-in-progress answers or questions so that I don't lose a ton of hard work and research and valuable knowledge I need myself just because my baby got poop on the couch and I have to go clean it up, or some other family emergency or event has happened and I have to suddenly stop without warning to go handle it.
