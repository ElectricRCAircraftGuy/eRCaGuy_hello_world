These are incomplete examples, or practice or scratch work where I am trying to quickly test something. These examples may not run properly, have good output, or fully demonstrate any particular principles. Once I get an example polished and fully working, with example code and instructions on how to run it, I'll move it out of this folder and into the folder above, or in another folder in the folder above. That is where the more-polished and fully-functioning examples are stored.
