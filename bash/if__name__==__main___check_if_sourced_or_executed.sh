# if__name__==__main___check_if_sourced_or_executed.sh

# By Gabriel Staples
# First written: 10 Jan. 2022

# Test if this bash script is being sourced or executed. This could be useful, for instance, to only
# run certain things if the file is being executed, but to NOT run them if this file is being
# sourced, since sourcing this script might be just to pull in some functions from it which the
# script doing the sourcing might want to use from this script!
#
# This would be akin to using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` check in Python.

# Test run:
# For all cases, first do:
#           cd path/to/eRCaGuy_hello_world
# 1. Execute the script in 2 ways:
#   A. As an executable script
#           ./bash/if__name__==__main___check_if_sourced_or_executed.sh
#   B. By calling the bash interpreter
#           bash ./bash/if__name__==__main___check_if_sourced_or_executed.sh
# 2. Source the script in 2 ways:
#   A. Bash source call
#           source ./bash/if__name__==__main___check_if_sourced_or_executed.sh
#   B. (Recommended) POSIX-compliant source call
#           . ./bash/if__name__==__main___check_if_sourced_or_executed.sh
