Fall 2022

Write the most-basic sdbus shell of an sdbus server application in C to receive some commands
over sdbus, and a basic client app in C to send it those commands.

Also send the cmd using `busctl` at the command-line as the client application. Show how to do the
equivalent of that `busctl` cmd in a C program.
