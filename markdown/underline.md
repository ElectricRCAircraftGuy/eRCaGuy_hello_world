Demonstrate underlined text, as I explain how to do in my answer here: [Get underlined text with Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66595330/4561887)

1. Markdown:
    ```html
    <u>this is underlined text in HTML or markdown, which accepts HTML</u>
    ```
    Result:  
    <u>this is underlined text in HTML or markdown, which accepts HTML</u>


Now attempt to make a heading underlined:

## Regular heading

## <u>Underlined heading</u>
