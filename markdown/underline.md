Demonstrate underlined text, as I explain how to do in my answer here: [Get underlined text with Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66595330/4561887)

---

Markdown:
```html
<u>this is underlined text in HTML or markdown, which accepts HTML</u>
```
Result:  
<u>this is underlined text in HTML or markdown, which accepts HTML</u>

Now attempt to make a heading underlined:

Markdown:
```html
## Regular heading
```
Result:  
## Regular heading

Markdown:
```html
## <u>Underlined heading</u>
```
Result:  
## <u>Underlined heading</u>
