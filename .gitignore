# Gitignore File Formatting Notes:
# - add a / *after* a name to indicate a folder, and leave it off to indicate a file; ex: `folder/`, `file`
# - Add a / *before* a name to indicate it is an absolute-style path starting at this repository's "root" directory, or in other words, the directory where the git repo's ".git" folder is located; ex: `/folder/`, `/file`
#   - See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43555850/git-gitignore-to-ignore-only-folder-in-root-directory/43555863#43555863
# - Use asterisks (*) for wildcards; ex: `/mydir/*/*.cpp`
# - Add an exclamanation mark (!) *before* a path to indicate you do NOT want it ignored, even if it otherwise matches a path to ignore; ex:
#   ```
#   /ignored_dir/                           # ignore this dir
#   !/ignored_dir/special_file_to_include   # EXCEPT for this file--DO include it!
#   ```
