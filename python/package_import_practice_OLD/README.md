Importing Python packages and modules has proven to be a _real pain in the butt_! They are so flippin' convoluted in Python. Ex: see here: 1.5 **million** people have this question!: [Relative imports in Python 3](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16981921/4561887). 

Over the course of 4 days of work or so, I figured it out. This folder contains some of that "work in progress" work along the way, that I neither want to fix up and finalize, nor delete.

My full and final answer and notes will be posted on Stack Overflow shortly.
