Description:
By Gabriel Staples
Written 8-9 Apr. 2022
Print "Hey George", with the index number first, 10 times.

Contributed to my code repository 9 Apr. 2022 in memory of my wife's grandpa, George, who married
and sealed us. He died 23 March 2022, just 12 days after he and I wrote this code together. At the
time he died he was 88 years old, just 2 days before his 89th birthday. We went to visit him in Los
Alamos, NM, and he asked what I do. He knows virtually nothing about computers and technology, not
even what the internet is really, nor what a router is. He can hardly use email with assistance, and
he still has a flip phone.

I talked briefly about programming and said, "You know what! Let me just show you." He and I then
sat down together in some chairs in his master bedroom, with him in a white button up dress shirt
and nice jeans, on oxygen with tubes in his nose, and we wrote this code together while I talked
about programming, "for" loops, and how all computers and technology are built up in chunks of code
and building blocks, just like nails and boards and other pieces in a house. I said, "the problem
with programming and software architecture, however, is that sometimes when building your house of
software, you need a nail that doesn't exist yet, and you have to pause to go make the 'nail'. But
then you realize you need the raw iron to make the nail, and a forge to melt the iron to make the
nail, and the wood to heat it, and you need to go find, borrow, or make all of those things too.
Something that seems so simple on the outside to the untrained observer can take weeks or months or
more to build up a little at a time in code." He was in the construction business in his life, so I
think he could understand the analogy of building software to building a house.

His mind was blown. He asked if I thought self-driving cars were really coming (I work as a senior
embedded software engineer on self-driving cars at Cruise right now; see:
https://www.getcruise.com/), and I said "yes". He said, "I'd never trust one of those things to
drive me around", and I said, "I know, but they're coming. Just as surely as the horse and buggy
were replaced by cars, regular cars will be replaced by self-driving cars." I said, "that doesn't
mean all self-driving cars won't have a steering wheel. I think most cars will continue to have a
steering wheel, at least for the next 100 years or so, to allow drivers to drive them manually when
they want to feel in control, or when they want to go off-roading or just have fun with them, but
most if not all cars will be self-driving within 100 years." Again, his mind was blown. He said he
didn't think he'd get in one. Referring to peoples' natural resistance to change as we grow older,
we agreed that older generations passing away is frequently part of the process of progression
which welcomes and allows drastic changes and progress like this to happen.

I mentioned that I saw a presentation once at AFRL (Air Force Research Laboratory) in ~2013 that
when the automobile was first invented, they were limited to a max speed of 5 mph in New York City,
and a flag person had to walk before the automobile saying, "An automobile is coming! An automobile
is coming." A second flag bearer had to walk behind the car as well, for "safety", to protect the
horses and buggies from this unruly beast of a machine which certainly could not be trusted because
it didn't eat nor drink nor have a mind of its own. It was **dangerous** because it was new and did
not have a conscience, self-awareness, and a brain! Anyway, similar opinions and inhibitions
sometimes exist about the self-driving car today. But, they will pass. Electric charge stations
will be build. Infrastructure will be built, and even in 30 years self-driving cars will be fairly
common-place in many large cities throughout the world.

Grandpa George said he was looking forward to seeing his wife again, who had died years earlier. He
was ready to go, and was looking forward to passing on to the next life. He wanted to be with his
wife again. He was ready to go. I put my computer away and we had a nice visit. We had printed "Hey
George" 10 times to the computer screen in Python.

May he rest in peace and find love in the arms of his wife, and his Savior, Jesus Christ.

So, what happens after death?

I believe the following:

I believe George probably has not seen Jesus Christ yet, but certainly will see Him at some point in
the future. When we die, our spirits separate from our bodies. Our spirits, and our conscience,
which is what makes us "us", go to the Spirit World, either in a state of happiness called Spirit
Paradise, or in a state of misery called Spirit Prison. People living in Spirit Paradise can teach
the Gospel of Jesus Christ to those in Spirit Prison. There is much work to do. It is not an idle
place, but it *is* a place of rest from physical bodily cares and needs and worries and pains--just
a very busy place of rest where there is much work to do. You will *not* instantly see Christ. You
will *not* instantly be changed to anything other than what you were at the moment you died. Your
mind will be with you, and your personality, mind, thoughts, knowledge, beliefs, etc., will be the
same in the Spirit World as they were when you died, or as they *would have been* when you died had
you been in a healthy physical body (in the case of mental degeneration or other physical
impairment or handicap). In other words, you will still be "you." Your knowledge and personality
will still be with you. Engineers and scientists will still understand the truths of engineering
and science. Programmers will still understand and follow the truth of computers, computation,
electronics, physics, and electrical engineering. Non-Christians will still be non-Christian.
Stubborn people will still be stubborn. People who swear and use foul language will still swear and
use foul language. People who desire to do evil and to harm one another or abuse each other will
still desire to do these evil things. Lazy people will still be lazy. Hard workers will still be
hard workers. Drug addicts will still be drug addicts, except they will be in constant torment
because they no longer have a physical body to take drugs to satisfy their cravings. Other
addictions will still be present, except they also will not be able to be satisfied if a physical
body is required to satisfy them. This includes sex addictions, alcohol, tobacco, etc.

Anyway, George is still George, except now I think he gets to see his wife. After some time in the
Spirit World, working to teach people the Gospel of Jesus Christ, he will be brought before Christ
to be judged of his works, thoughts, actions, attitudes, beliefs, etc., as will *all* people in the
Spirit World. At that moment there will be no doubt for him nor for anyone else who stands before
Jesus that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world.

That is the moment that the scriptures talk of when they say:
    > For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue
      shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
      (Romans 14:11-12, New Testament:
      https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/14?lang=eng)

And:
    > 31 Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day,
      when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then
      shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting
      punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the
      glance of his all-searching eye.
      (Mosiah 27:31, Book of Mormon:
      https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng)

Anyway, I believe George to be in Spirit Paradise in a state of happiness and physical rest until
his judgement and resurrection. But, he's got much work to do.

From The Plan of Salvation pamphlet of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, p10-12,
https://media.ldscdn.org/pdf/manuals/the-plan-of-salvation/36950-the-plan-of-salvation-eng.pdf?lang=eng:

    > At death, your spirit will leave your body and go to the spirit world, which is a place of
      learning and preparation. In the spirit world, your memories of this life will remain with
      you. Death will not change your personality or your desire for good or evil. If you choose to
      follow Christ during your life on earth, you will be at peace in the spirit world and will
      rest from your cares. Those who choose not to follow Jesus Christ and do not repent will be
      unhappy.
    > ...
    > Resurrection and Judgment:
    > One of the great gifts of God to all who come to earth is the resurrection, which is made
      possible by the Atonement of Jesus Christ. When Jesus died on the cross, His spirit went to
      the spirit world. Three days later, His spirit was reunited with His glorified, perfected
      body that could no longer die. This reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection.
      Everyone who is born on earth will be resurrected. After you are resurrected, you will go
      before God to be judged according to your works and the desires of your heart.

    > Degrees of Glory:

    > After you are judged, you will live in a state of glory. Because everyone’s works and desires
      vary, heaven includes different kingdoms, or degrees of glory.

    > **Celestial kingdom.** Our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ reside in the celestial kingdom.
      If you live according to the gospel of Jesus Christ and are cleansed from sin by the
      Atonement, you will receive a place in this, the highest kingdom. You will live in God’s
      presence and know complete joy.
    > **Terrestrial kingdom.** People who refuse to accept the gospel of Jesus Christ but who live
      honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom.
    > **Telestial kingdom.** Those who continue in their sins and do not repent will receive a place
      in the telestial kingdom.
