# What is Pandas?

Me: 
> What is Pandas?

GitHub Copilot:
> **Pandas** is a popular open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets, as well as tools for data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and visualization.
> 
> The two primary data structures in Pandas are the `Series` and `DataFrame` objects. A `Series` is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, while a `DataFrame` is a two-dimensional table-like object that can hold multiple `Series` objects. Pandas also provides many functions for working with these data structures, including functions for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.
> 
> Pandas is widely used in data science, finance, and other fields where large datasets need to be analyzed and manipulated. It is often used in conjunction with other Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn** to create powerful data analysis and visualization tools.

From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software):

>  The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.
