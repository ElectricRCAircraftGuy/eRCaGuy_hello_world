TODO:
1. [ ] Try out this code, and see if its results vary from mine. It might just be a different
   mathematical way to do the same thing. I'm not sure, but the pitch equation is definitely
   different, for instance:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles#Source_code_2
1. [ ] experiment with the `scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation` class and its methods, such as
   `from_quat()` and `from_euler()`, etc., too.
1. [ ] get out my Aero books and old college notes and other resources and study up on spacial
   transformations and rotation matrices and things.
1. [ ] Gain a solid understanding of this topic of quaternions.
1. [ ] Read about "gimbal lock" and how to avoid it, too.

# <========================  Discussion with @Ebernardes; SciPy, and Sympy  ========================
# BOTH of the `quaternion2euler()` functions below work, and produce the exact same results for my
# test cases. However, **the Wikipedia version is the better one,** because it has had the pitch
# equation modified by @Ebernardes to use `arctan2()` instead of `arcsin()` in order to be more
# numerically stable. Ebernardes states to me: "Basically, arcsin, arccos are not as numerically
# well-behaved as arctan2, which is why we used this version when I updated the transformation code
# in https://scipy.org/." Ebernardes has helped write these functions in both SciPy and Sympy. See
# his response to me (where I am @ERCaGuy) in the Wikipedia Talk page here:

    OPTION 1: [USE THIS ONE] The Wikipedia version, with the pitch equation modified by @Ebernardes:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles#Source_code_2

    > this implementation assumes normalized quaternion converts to Euler angles in 3-2-1 sequence.

    This means the order of the rotations is:
    1. Z-axis rotation (yaw)
    1. Y-axis rotation (pitch)
    1. X-axis rotation (roll)

    ---

    Summary:
    Convert 4 quaternion values to 3 Euler angles in degrees in the ZYX order (according to GitHub
    Copilot), AKA the 3-2-1 sequence, AKA the "yaw, pitch, roll" sequence.

    Inputs:
    q is a numpy array of shape (4,) representing a quaternion [a, b, c, d]; it can be a list,
    tuple, or numpy array of single (scalar) values OR of Pandas Series objects OR of more numpy
    arrays of values.

    Returns:
    A tuple of Euler angles (phi, theta, psi) in degrees
    - phi   = roll,  +/- 180 deg, rotation around x-axis
    - theta = pitch, +/-  90 deg, rotation around y-axis
    - psi   = yaw,   +/- 180 deg, rotation around z-axis
