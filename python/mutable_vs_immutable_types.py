Test which types are **mutable** (have side effects, and are passed **by
reference**) vs which are **immutable** (do NOT have side effects, and are
passed **by value**).

Status: Done and works!
TODO:
1. [ ] Add `id()` checks to show that the underlying object is the same or not.
    See:
    1. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is-not
